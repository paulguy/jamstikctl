jamstikctl - Control parameters of Zivix Jamstik MIDI guitars.

BUILDING
--------
Needs:
    A jack library, tested with pipewire-jack.
    json-c

    and of course, development headers/libs for these things and all the other
    usual stuff you need for C development

Should just work typing `make`.

USING
-----
Not much to use yet, just run it but it doesn't do anything other than testing
communication once connected.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Automatically connecting to the guitar device fails requiring the user to
connect it to the application manually.  I don't know if this is my issue or
an issue with pipewire-jack.
