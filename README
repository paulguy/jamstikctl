jamstikctl - Control parameters of Zivix Jamstik MIDI guitars.

BUILDING
--------
Needs:
    A jack library, tested with pipewire-jack.
    json-c

    and of course, development headers/libs for these things and all the other
    usual stuff you need for C development

Should just work typing `make`.

USING
-----
Run it on its own, it takes no arguments.  It should connect to the plugged in
guitar already, but if not it'll prompt you through manual connection.

For now it outputs a lot of noisy information, that might be removed or made a
way to change its verbosity.

Input is done by keypress:
q : quit
0-9 : number entry for numeric values sent to the guitar.  Data isn't sent
      until an actual data entry key press is pressed.
- : toggle positive/negative value
C : clear value to 0 (that is capital C)
w : Toggle expression (loudness) events
e : Toggle pitch bend events
r : Toggle MPE mode
t : Set transposition for the entire guitar
y : toggle outputting all events to a single channel or each string to a
    channel, high E on the lowest channel.
u : set base MIDI channel, either the single channel or the first channel for
    high E string.  No effect in MPE mode.
i : set pitch bend range in semitones, more range results in less precision as
    more range of frequencies is scaled to the same precision value
o : set pitch bend range in cents
p : toggle transcription mode
a : set minimum velocity range, values are scaled in to this range
s : set maximum velocity range
d : set open note value per string ? (seems to stop output though? )
f : set string trigger sensitivity, higher for more sensitivity
z,x,c,v,b,n : select string starting from low E
